The following code is a rather weird and barely functional (as of November 2022) port of [mod_offhangar v1.0.0.0](https://bitbucket.org/IzeBerg/mod_offhangar/src/ef24c702c2b0ef64b9f49f8e12596a8b1533f301/) created for World of Tanks 0.9.22.0.1 to World of Tanks 0.8.2, which targets the same task â€” allow the user to explore hangar UI in offline mode, inspect vehicles, etc.

Requires [Python 2.6.6 x32](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-266/) to be compiled and used in the game or extract two files from [this archive](https://static.omlauncher.ru/files/ww/mod_offhangar_legacy/python26.7z) into your PjOrion folder and change your Python library to python26.dll via Terminal -> Settings -> Basic setup.
